## Python Code Examples

All the examples are available [here](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/tree/master/examples).


#### Face Detection

* [Find faces in a photograph](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/find_faces_in_picture.py)
* [Find faces in a photograph (using deep learning)](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/find_faces_in_picture_cnn.py)
* [Find faces in batches of images w/ GPU (using deep learning)](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/find_faces_in_batches.py)

#### Facial Features

* [Identify specific facial features in a photograph](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/find_facial_features_in_picture.py)
* [Apply (horribly ugly) digital make-up](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/digital_makeup.py)

#### Facial Recognition

* [Find and recognize unknown faces in a photograph based on photographs of known people](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/recognize_faces_in_pictures.py)
* [Compare faces by numeric face distance instead of only True/False matches](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/face_distance.py)
* [Recognize faces in live video using your webcam - Simple / Slower Version (Requires OpenCV to be installed)](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/facerec_from_webcam.py)
* [Recognize faces in live video using your webcam - Faster Version (Requires OpenCV to be installed)](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/facerec_from_webcam_faster.py)
* [Recognize faces in a video file and write out new video file (Requires OpenCV to be installed)](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/facerec_from_video_file.py)
* [Recognize faces on a Raspberry Pi w/ camera](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/facerec_on_raspberry_pi.py)
* [Run a web service to recognize faces via HTTP (Requires Flask to be installed)](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/web_service_example.py)
* [Recognize faces with a K-nearest neighbors classifier](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/face_recognition_knn.py)
## How Face Recognition Works

If you want to learn how face location and recognition work instead of
depending on a black box library, [read my article](https://medium.com/@ageitgey/machine-learning-is-fun-part-4-modern-face-recognition-with-deep-learning-c3cffc121d78).
